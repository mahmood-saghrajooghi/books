# Book-highlight filing guideline

Follow these steps whenever the user provides a book highlight.

1. Identify the book title
   • It is usually included in the pasted text, e.g.
     `Atomic Habits — page 23:` or `"Deep Work" – Cal Newport:`
   • If you cannot determine the title, ask the user.

2. File location & naming
   • One markdown file per book in the repo-root `books/` folder.
   • The filename is the kebab-case slug of the title, e.g.
     `Atomic Habits` → `atomic-habits.md`.
   • Full relative path example: `books/atomic-habits.md`.

3. File schema
   ```markdown
   # <Book title>

   ## Highlights

   - <highlight 1>
   - <highlight 2>
   ```

4. Adding a new highlight
   a. If the file exists, append the highlight as a new bullet under **Highlights**.
   b. If it does not exist, create the file with the schema above, using the new highlight as the first bullet.
   c. NEVER delete or rewrite existing bullets—only append.
   d. Preserve the exact punctuation and line-breaks provided by the user.

5. After updating or creating the file, show the diff / resulting markdown to the user for confirmation.

Notes
• Do not wrap highlight text in quotes—just `- <text>`.
• Keep bullets in the order added (newest last).
• Ask follow-up questions only when the title is ambiguous.
